Note to people who want to use the Ant build script on Mac:

The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is used in the script, and it may not already be set for you. You can have it set automatically at launch by following [this tutorial] (http://www.dowdandassociates.com/blog/content/howto-set-an-environment-variable-in-mac-os-x-launchd-plist/) (that's how I got it working).
