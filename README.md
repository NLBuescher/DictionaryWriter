Note to people who want to use the Ant build script:

The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is used in the script, and it may not already be set for you. You can set it by using the command `launchctl setenv JAVA_HOME PATH/TO/JAVA/HOME`. This will have to be redone every reboot. For Windows, a quick google search should get you where you need to be.
