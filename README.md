# DictionaryWriter

**NOTE:** The project is not currently being worked on. The work done and lessons learned here may at some later point get incorporated into another dictionary oriented project, but there will likely not be more updates to this project.

Note to people who want to use the Ant build script:

The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is used in the script, and it may not already be set for you. You can set it by using the command `launchctl setenv JAVA_HOME PATH/TO/JAVA/HOME`. This will have to be redone every reboot. For Windows, a quick google search should get you where you need to be.
